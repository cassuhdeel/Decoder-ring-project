## Decoder-ring-project

Decoder Ring is a simple application that uses JavaScript, and HTML to make an encoder and decoder. This application is insipired by Julius Ceasar's, 'Ceasar Shift', encryption technique he used to protect military messages he sent. This project was designed to test my skills with JavaScript and HTML while using TDD.

The functions in this project allow a user to input a message and recieve the message back but encrypted using the encryption methods.

While develping this project I learned exactly how hard enrcryption and decryption is. Those who crack these codes are brillliant!
